# Prototypal Inheritance

Understanding the usage of Prototypal Inheritance

## Objectives

We have covered Javascript variables, functions, objects and callbacks but, we have not used **prototypes** or **constructors** yet.

By the end of this lesson, you should know how to:

-  Use Prototypal Inheritance
-  Understand the usage and flexibility it allows
<!-- -   Create an object prototype
-   Create new objects from the same prototype -->
-  Vocabulary


## Preparation

1.  Fork and clone this repository.

1.  Create a new branch, `training`, for your work and change into it.

1.  Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Why use Prototypal Inheritance?

1. It's flexible.

## Vocabulary

**Prototype** - A working object instance. In JavaScript it is an object in which other JavaScript objects inherit their properties and methods from.

**Inheritence** - Code reuse mechanism

**Prototypal Inheritance** -An object or class that is based on another object

**Constructor** -
**Instance** -


```js

```


```js

```

```js
let primitive;
let otherPrimitive;
let reference;
let otherReference;
```

### Demo: Functions

```js
const five = function() {
  return 5;
};

const add = function(a, b){
  a + b;
};
```


### Code Along:

```js
const helloWorld = function(){
  return "Hello World!";
};

const hello = function(name){
  return "Hello " + name;
};
```
