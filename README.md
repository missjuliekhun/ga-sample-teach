# Prototypal Inheritance

Understanding the usage of Prototypal Inheritance

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, developers should be able to:

-  Why use Prototypal Inheritance
-  Vocabulary
-   Create an object prototype
-   Create new objects from the same prototype

## Preparation

1.  [Fork and clone](https://github.com/missjuliekhun/ga-sample-teach)
    this repository.

1.  Create a new branch, `training`, for your work and change into it.

1.  Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Vocabulary

Prototype
A working object instance. Object inherit directly from other objects.  



```js

```


```js

```

```js
let primitive;
let otherPrimitive;
let reference;
let otherReference;
```

### Demo: Functions

```js
const five = function() {
  return 5;
};

const add = function(a, b){
  a + b;
};
```


### Code Along:

```js
const helloWorld = function(){
  return "Hello World!";
};

const hello = function(name){
  return "Hello " + name;
};
```
